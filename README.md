You are a wandering warrior in search of riches and glory. Nothing matters to you anymore except getting what you want, when you want it. Then one day you come upon a strange jewel with mystical powers, and everything is flipped on its head. Elemental beings of all varieties are hunting you down, trying to recover the strange gem, and you must restore order to it all.
