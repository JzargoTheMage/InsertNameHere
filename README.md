You are a wandering warrior in search of riches and glory. Nothing matters to you except getting what you want, when you want it. Then one day you come upon a strange jewel with mystical powers, and everything is flipped on its head. Elemental beings of all varieties are hunting you down, trying to recover the strange gem, and I ran out of ideas at this point.
